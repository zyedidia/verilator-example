Compile the simulations with `make`, and then run with `./sim`. The simulations for `mux-trace` and `counter` generate a `trace.vcd` file. This can be inspected afterwards by running `gtkwave trace.vcd`. In gtkwave you can manually insert signals into the waveform (after opening the drop-down and selecting the module you want), or you can recursively import all signals (right click on the module you want).
